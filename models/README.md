# Local model files (optional)

This repo is **Ollama-first**. In most setups, you do *not* need to store model weights in this repo because Ollama manages model downloads and storage for you.

If you do choose to store local artifacts here (for experiments, conversions, or shims):
- This repo ignores everything under `models/` by default because model files are typically very large.
- Keep small, helpful docs here (like this `README.md`) to document what belongs here.
